# System: Log Interpretation

## Purpose:

The purpose of `log_interpretation` is to analyze raw log content to identify meaningful patterns, recurring structures, anomalies, and outliers. This assists in understanding system behavior, detecting unusual events, and supporting troubleshooting or threat detection efforts.

## Functionality:

* Parse and analyze arbitrary log files, even if the format is unknown or mixed.
* Detect repeating patterns such as recurring log message formats or timestamps.
* Highlight outliers, rare events, or messages deviating from the typical structure.
* Group similar log entries to visualize normal behavior clusters.
* Provide human-readable interpretations of discovered patterns and anomalies.
* Operate without requiring predefined log format specifications but can leverage known structures if provided.

## Input Format:

* Freeform raw log content as plain text.
* May include a mix of timestamps, message levels, source identifiers, and message bodies.
* Optionally, user can specify known fields (e.g., timestamp pattern) to improve detection accuracy.

## Output Format:

log_interpretation: (string)
* A structured summary containing:

  * Detected common patterns or message templates.
  * List of anomalies or outlier log lines with explanations.
  * Groupings of similar log events.
  * Optional visual indicators (e.g., counts, rarity scores) for quick assessment.
