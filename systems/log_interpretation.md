# System: Log Interpretation

## Purpose:

The purpose of `log_interpretation` is to analyze raw log content to identify meaningful patterns, recurring structures, anomalies, and outliers. This assists in understanding system behavior, detecting unusual events, and supporting troubleshooting or threat detection efforts.

## Functionality:

* Parse and analyze arbitrary log files, even if the format is unknown or mixed.
* Detect repeating patterns such as recurring log message formats or timestamps.
* Highlight outliers, rare events, or messages deviating from the typical structure.
* Group similar log entries to visualize normal behavior clusters.
* Provide human-readable interpretations of discovered patterns and anomalies.
* Operate without requiring predefined log format specifications but can leverage known structures if provided.

## System Inputs:

```yaml
inputs:
  - name: log_content
    description: Log content to analyze
    type: text
    required: true
    alternative_to: log_file

  - name: log_file
    description: Path to the log file
    type: file
    required: true
    alternative_to: log_content

  - name: time_pattern
    description: Known timestamp pattern in the logs (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss')
    type: text
    ignore_undefined: true
    required: false

  - name: log_level
    description: Type of log levels to focus on
    type: select
    options: 
      - ERROR
      - WARN
      - INFO
      - DEBUG
      - ALL
    ignore_undefined: true
    required: false
    default: ALL

  - name: max_patterns
    description: Maximum number of patterns to identify
    type: number
    ignore_undefined: true
    required: false
    default: 10
    min: 1
    max: 100
```

## Output Format:

log_interpretation: (string)
* A structured summary containing:

  * Detected common patterns or message templates.
  * List of anomalies or outlier log lines with explanations.
  * Groupings of similar log events.
  * Optional visual indicators (e.g., counts, rarity scores) for quick assessment.
