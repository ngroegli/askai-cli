# System Description: KQL Query Generation
## Purpose:
This system takes natural language input and generates corresponding Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries. It does not execute the queries or return data results â€” it simply converts user questions into valid KQL syntax.

## Functionality:
Accepts a natural language question about data.

Outputs a valid, best-effort KQL query based on that input.

Optional support for contextual hints like table names or time filters.

## Input Format:
question: (string)
A natural language question describing what the user wants to retrieve or analyze.
Example: "Show the count of errors in the last 24 hours"

## Output Format:
kql_query: (string)
The generated KQL query based on the input question.

explanation: (string)
A plain-language description of what the query does, if enabled.

relevant_tables: (string)
List all tables for this kind of query.
