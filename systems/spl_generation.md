# System: SPL Query Generation

## Purpose:

This system takes natural language input and generates corresponding Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) queries. It does not execute the queries or return live data â€” it solely translates user questions into valid SPL syntax.

## Functionality:

* Accepts a natural language question about logs, metrics, or indexed data.
* Infers the expected output and understands the user's analytical goal.
* Outputs a valid, best-matching SPL query based on that input. If multiple valid approaches exist, up to three solutions are provided.
* Optionally incorporates contextual hints, such as known index names, source types, or time filters.

## System Inputs:

```yaml
inputs:
  - name: question
    description: A natural language description of what information or analysis you want from Splunk
    type: text
    required: true

  - name: index_hints
    description: Known Splunk index names that should be used in the query
    type: text
    required: false
    ignore_undefined: true

  - name: sourcetype_hints
    description: Known sourcetypes that should be considered
    type: text
    required: false
    ignore_undefined: true

  - name: time_range
    description: Specific time range to consider (e.g., '-7d', '-24h')
    type: text
    required: false

```

## Model Configuration:

```yaml
model:
  provider: openrouter
  model_name: anthropic/claude-2
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 2000

format_instructions: |
  When generating SPL queries:
  1. First provide a brief summary of the solutions
  2. Then provide detailed queries and explanations in JSON format
  3. Optionally include a query flow visualization for complex queries

example_conversation:
  - role: user
    content: |
      Find all failed login attempts in the last 24 hours
  - role: assistant
    content: |
      Summary:
      Generated 2 SPL queries for analyzing failed login attempts - a basic search with status filtering and a more detailed analysis with user statistics.
