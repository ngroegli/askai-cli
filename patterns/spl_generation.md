# Pattern: SPL Query Generation

## Purpose:

This system takes natural language input and generates corresponding Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) queries. It does not execute the queries or return live data â€” it solely translates user questions into valid SPL syntax.

## Functionality:

* Accepts a natural language question about logs, metrics, or indexed data.
* Infers the expected output and understands the user's analytical goal.
* Outputs a valid, best-matching SPL query based on that input. If multiple valid approaches exist, up to three solutions are provided.
* Optionally incorporates contextual hints, such as known index names, source types, or time filters.

## Pattern Inputs:

```yaml
inputs:
  - name: question
    description: A natural language description of what information or analysis you want from Splunk
    type: text
    required: true

  - name: index_hints
    description: Known Splunk index names that should be used in the query
    type: text
    required: false
    ignore_undefined: true

  - name: sourcetype_hints
    description: Known sourcetypes that should be considered
    type: text
    required: false
    ignore_undefined: true

  - name: time_range
    description: Specific time range to consider (e.g., '-7d', '-24h')
    type: text
    required: false
    ignore_undefined: true
```

## Pattern Outputs:

```yaml
outputs:
  - name: result
    description: Primary SPL query (the best solution)
    type: text
    required: true
    example: "index=* sourcetype=* login failed OR failure earliest=-24h | stats count by user, src_ip | sort -count"

  - name: visual_output
    description: Formatted output with all SPL queries, explanations, and visualizations
    type: markdown
    required: true
    example: |
      # SPL Query Solutions
      
      ## Primary Query
      ```spl
      index=* sourcetype=* login failed OR failure earliest=-24h | stats count by user, src_ip | sort -count
      ```
      
      ### Explanation
      Statistical analysis showing top users and source IPs with failed logins
      
      ### Data Sources
      - **Indexes**: security, auth
      - **Sourcetypes**: auth*, security*
      - **Key Fields**: user, src_ip
      
      ## Alternative Query
      ```spl
      index=* sourcetype=* login failed OR failure earliest=-24h | table _time user src_ip status
      ```
      
      ### Explanation
      Basic search showing all failed logins with key fields in the last 24 hours
      
      ## Query Flow - Statistical Analysis
      ```mermaid
      graph TD
        A[Base Search] --> B[Time Filter]
        B --> C[Group by user/IP]
        C --> D[Sort by count]
      ```
```

## Model Configuration:

```yaml
model:
  provider: openrouter
  model_name: anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 2000
  
format_instructions: |
  **IMPORTANT**: Your response MUST follow this exact JSON format:
  
  ```json
  {
    "result": "THE_PRIMARY_SPL_QUERY_HERE",
    "visual_output": "THE_FORMATTED_OUTPUT_WITH_ALL_QUERIES_AND_EXPLANATIONS"
  }
  ```
  
  Where:
  - `result`: Contains ONLY the direct SPL query (the best solution) with no markdown formatting or explanations
  - `visual_output`: Contains all queries, explanations, and visualizations in a formatted markdown presentation
  
  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "result": "index=* sourcetype=* login failed OR failure earliest=-24h | stats count by user, src_ip | sort -count",
    "visual_output": "# SPL Query Solutions\n\n## Primary Query\n```spl\nindex=* sourcetype=*...(more content)..."
  }
  ```
  
  For complex queries, include diagrams and explanations in the visual_output section only.
```

## Model Configuration:

format_instructions: |
  When generating SPL queries:
  1. First provide a brief summary of the solutions
  2. Then provide detailed queries and explanations in JSON format
  3. Optionally include a query flow visualization for complex queries

example_conversation:
  - role: user
    content: |
      Find all failed login attempts in the last 24 hours
  - role: assistant
    content: |
      Summary:
      Generated 2 SPL queries for analyzing failed login attempts - a basic search with status filtering and a more detailed analysis with user statistics.
