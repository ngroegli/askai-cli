# Pattern: SPL Query Generation

## Purpose:

This system takes natural language input and generates corresponding Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) queries. It does not execute the queries or return live data â€” it solely translates user questions into valid SPL syntax.

## Functionality:

* Accepts a natural language question about logs, metrics, or indexed data.
* Infers the expected output and understands the user's analytical goal.
* Outputs a valid, best-matching SPL query based on that input. If multiple valid approaches exist, up to three solutions are provided.
* Optionally incorporates contextual hints, such as known index names, source types, or time filters.

## Pattern Inputs:

```yaml
inputs:
  - name: question
    description: A natural language description of what information or analysis you want from Splunk
    type: text
    required: true

  - name: index_hints
    description: Known Splunk index names that should be used in the query
    type: text
    required: false
    ignore_undefined: true

  - name: sourcetype_hints
    description: Known sourcetypes that should be considered
    type: text
    required: false
    ignore_undefined: true

  - name: time_range
    description: Specific time range to consider (e.g., '-7d', '-24h')
    type: text
    required: false
    ignore_undefined: true
```

## Pattern Outputs:

```yaml
results:
  - name: explanation
    description: Formatted output with all SPL queries, explanations, and visualizations
    type: markdown
    required: true

      # SPL Query Solutions
      
      ## Primary Query
      ```spl
      index=* sourcetype=* login failed OR failure earliest=-24h | stats count by user, src_ip | sort -count
      ```
      
      ### Explanation
      Statistical analysis showing top users and source IPs with failed logins
      
      ### Data Sources
      - **Indexes**: security, auth
      - **Sourcetypes**: auth*, security*
      - **Key Fields**: user, src_ip
      
      ## Alternative Query
      ```spl
      index=* sourcetype=* login failed OR failure earliest=-24h | table _time user src_ip status
      ```
      
      ### Explanation
      Basic search showing all failed logins with key fields in the last 24 hours

      ```
```
