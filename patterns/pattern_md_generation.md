# Pattern: Pattern MD Generation

## Purpose:

The purpose of this pattern is to automatically create well-structured pattern files in markdown format based on a concise goal description. It generates complete, standardized pattern files that follow the project's template structure, ensuring consistency across all pattern definitions while saving time and eliminating manual formatting errors.

## Functionality:

* Generate complete pattern markdown files from a concise goal description
* Create all required sections in the correct order and format:
  * Pattern title based on the goal or user-provided name
  * Purpose section with clear explanation of the pattern's objectives
  * Functionality section with bullet points of key capabilities
  * Input section with properly formatted YAML parameters
  * Output section with well-defined result fields
  * Model configuration section with appropriate settings
  * Format instructions that match the pattern's requirements
* Apply standardized formatting and structure to ensure consistency
* Validate the generated pattern against best practices and provide feedback
* Automatically save the pattern to a file with an appropriate name
* Support custom model configurations to match the pattern's complexity
