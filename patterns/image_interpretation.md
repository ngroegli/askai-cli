# Pattern: Image Interpretation

## Purpose:

The purpose of `image_interpretation` is to analyze and provide detailed descriptions of images from either local file paths or web URLs. This system helps users understand image content without needing visual access, supports accessibility needs, and extracts meaningful information from visual data.

## Functionality:

* Analyze images from local file paths or web URLs
* Provide detailed descriptions of image content, subjects, and context
* Identify key elements, objects, people, text, and other visual information
* Interpret the mood, style, and potential purpose of images
* Detect and describe relationships between elements in the image
* Support accessibility needs by offering comprehensive textual alternatives to visual content
